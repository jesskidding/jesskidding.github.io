### Ciphertext:
- Encrypted information, known as ciphertext, is the product of deciphering plaintext.

### Cipher:
- The process of encrypting and decrypting information is called a cipher.
While most modern ciphers are cryptographic, many older ciphers, such as Caesar, are not.

### Encryption:
- To encrypt anything is to use a cipher to convert the information to unreadable ciphertext.

### Plaintext:

- Plaintext refers to information in its unencrypted form, which is often text but is not limited to that.
It might be a picture or any other kind of document.

### Encoding:

- It is important to note that encoding is NOT a kind of encryption, but rather a means of representing data, like base64.
Capable of being undone at once.

### Key:
- A piece of information called a "key" is required in order to successfully decode the ciphertext and recover the plaintext.

### Passphrase:
- A passphrase is a string of characters that may be used in place of or in addition to a password to secure a key.

### Asymmetric Encryption:
- In asymmetric encryption, the encrypting and decrypting keys are distinct.
 
### Symmetric Encryption:
- The two processes of encryption and decryption use the same key in symmetric encryption.

### Brute Force:
- Brute force attacks on cryptosystems test all possible combinations of passwords and keys.

### Cryptanalysis:
- The practice of attacking cryptography by discovering a flaw in its mathematical foundations is known as cryptanalysis.
