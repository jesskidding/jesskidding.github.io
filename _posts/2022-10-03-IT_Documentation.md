# Infrastructure and Documentation-Business Documents Defined

RFP:
- A request for proposal is a document that is used to solicit bids from potential suppliers for a product or service that your company plans to purchase. A request for proposal must include information such as why your organization requires the product or service, how it will be used, when bids will be reviewed, and a detailed list of what the vendor should include.

MOU:
- A Memorandum of Understanding is a written record of an agreement or contract between two or more parties. It is sometimes used as a sort of handshake in between the legally binding signature on a contract. The MOU can help speed up contract negotiations and define each party's specific concerns, but it is usually not a legally binding document. It doesn't give either party a lot of rights, doesn't give either party legal recourse, and isn't meant to cover every detail of the agreement to come.

MSA:
- A master service agreement, is a contract that sets out the terms of future contracts between the parties, such as how payments will be made or how disputes will be settled.

SOW:
- Statements of work describe the work that needs to be done for a specific project. They include details like tasks, deliverables, standards, payment schedules, and work timelines. Statements of work are enforceable by law, which means they can be used as evidence in court. As an addition to an existing master service agreement, this document is often used to define the conditions of each new project.
    
SLA:
- Service-level agreements are contracts or parts of contracts that are legally binding. They describe the parts of a service provided to a client, like internet service, in plain language and in contexts that can be measured. Details could include contract length, guaranteed uptime, options for compensation if outages last longer than a certain amount of time, problem management, benchmarks for performance, and ways to end the contract.
    
MLA:
- Master license agreements offer rights to a third party from creators, developers, or producers, such as a software producer, for the purpose of selling, sublicensing, or distributing the product to customers as a standalone product or as element of another product. These agreements are not intended to be enforceable contracts, although there are several instances in which they may be, particularly if money is transferred.
