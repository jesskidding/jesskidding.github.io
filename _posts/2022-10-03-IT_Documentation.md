# Infrastructure and Documentation - Business Documents Defined

## RFP:
- A Request for Proposal (RFP) is a document used to solicit bids from potential suppliers for a product or service that your company plans to purchase. An RFP must include information such as why your organization requires the product or service, how it will be used, when bids will be reviewed, and a detailed list of what the vendor should include.

## MOU:
- A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is a written record of an agreement or contract between two or more parties. It is sometimes used as a sort of handshake before the legally binding signature on a contract. An MOU can help speed up contract negotiations and define each party's specific concerns, but it is usually not a legally binding document. It doesn't give either party a lot of rights, doesn't provide legal recourse, and isn't meant to cover every detail of the forthcoming agreement.

## MSA:
- A Master Service Agreement (MSA) is a contract that sets out the terms of future contracts between the parties, such as payment methods or dispute resolution processes.

## SOW:
- Statements of Work (SOW) describe the work that needs to be done for a specific project. They include details like tasks, deliverables, standards, payment schedules, and work timelines. SOWs are legally enforceable, which means they can be used as evidence in court. This document is often used as an addition to an existing Master Service Agreement to define the conditions of each new project.

## SLA:
- Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) are legally binding contracts or parts of contracts. They describe the aspects of a service provided to a client, such as internet service, in plain language and measurable contexts. Details could include contract length, guaranteed uptime, compensation options for outages exceeding a certain duration, problem management, performance benchmarks, and contract termination methods.

## MLA:
- Master License Agreements (MLAs) grant rights to a third party from creators, developers, or producers, such as a software producer, for the purpose of selling, sublicensing, or distributing the product to customers as a standalone product or as part of another product. These agreements are not intended to be enforceable contracts, although there are instances in which they may be, especially if money is exchanged.
